            <h2>Welcome to the Tech Returners Surgery</h2>
            <h3>COVID RESTRICTION UPDATE</h3>
            <article>
                <p> Throughout the pandemic we have strove to make the surgery as safe as possible for all our
                    patients
                    and staff, we will continue to do so.</p>
                <em> From the 19TH JULY 2021 NOTHING WILL CHANGE AT THE SURGERY â€“ Patients will still need to wear
                    a mask,
                    socially distance and
                    use hand sanitiser in the surgery and staff will continue to wear PPE.</em>
                <p>
                    <em><strong> If you arrive without a mask and are not exempt, you will be asked to
                            leave.</strong></em>
