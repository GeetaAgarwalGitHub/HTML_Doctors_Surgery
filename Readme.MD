Task:
The task is to create a web page for Doctor's surgery. 
User Requirements can be found in the doctors-surgery-user-requirements.pdf


Since the header and footer are repeated in each page, I have included them via script.
To view a fully working app, can run this file in http-server.

1> Have Node.js installed in your system.

2> In CMD, run the command npm install http-server -g

3> Navigate to the specific path of your file folder in CMD and run the command http-server

4> Go to your browser and type localhost:8080. The application should run there.
